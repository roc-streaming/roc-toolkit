//! Jitter meter parameters.
//!
//! Mean jitter is calculated as moving average of last `jitter_window` packets.
//!
//! Peak jitter calculation is performed in several steps:
//!
//!  1. Calculate jitter envelope - a curve that outlines jitter extremes.
//!     Envelope calculation is based on a smoothing window
//!     (`envelope_smoothing_window_len`) and a peak detector with capacitor
//!     (`envelope_resistance_exponent`, `envelope_resistance_coeff`).
//!
//!  2. Calculate moving quantile of the envelope - a line above certain percentage
//!     of the envelope values across moving window (`peak_quantile_coeff`,
//!     `peak_quantile_window`).
//!
//!  3. Calculate moving maximum of the envelope's quantile across last `jitter_window`
//!     samples. This is the resulting peak jitter.
struct JitterMeterConfig {
    //! Number of packets for calculating long-term jitter sliding statistics.
    //! @remarks
    //!  Increase this value if you want slower and smoother reaction.
    //!  Peak jitter is not decreased until jitter envelope is low enough
    //!  during this window.
    //! @note
    //!  Default value is about a few minutes.
    size_t jitter_window;

    //! Number of packets in small smoothing window to calculate jitter envelope.
    //! @remarks
    //!  The larger is this value, the rougher is jitter envelope.
    //! @note
    //!  Default value is a few packets.
    size_t envelope_smoothing_window_len;

    //! Exponent coefficient of capacitor resistance used in jitter envelope.
    //! @note
    //!  Capacitor discharge resistance is (peak ^ exp) * coeff, where `peak` is
    //!  the jitter peak size relative to the average jitter, `exp` is
    //!  `envelope_resistance_exponent`, and `coeff` is `envelope_resistance_coeff`.

    //!  stronger than impact of low spikes.

    //!  `envelope_resistance_exponent`, and `coeff` is `envelope_resistance_coeff`.

    //!  Increase this value to make impact to the peak jitter of frequent spikes
    //!  stronger than impact of rare spikes.
    double envelope_resistance_coeff;

    //! Number of packets for calculating envelope quantile.
    //! @remarks
    //!  This window size is used to calculate moving quantile of the envelope.
    //! @note
    //!  This value is the compromise between reaction speed to the increased
    //!  jitter and ability to distinguish rare spikes from frequent ones.
    //!  If you increase this value, we can detect and cut out more spikes that
    //!  are harmless, but we react to the relevant spikes a bit slower.
    size_t peak_quantile_window;

    //! Coefficient of envelope quantile from 0 to 1.
    //! @remarks
    //!  Defines percentage of the envelope that we want to cut out.
    //! @note
    //!  E.g. value 0.9 means that we want to draw a line that is above 90%
    //!  of all envelope values across the quantile window.

    //! Initialize the decoder with codec-specific headers.
    //!
    //! @b Parameters
    //!  - @p headers - pointer to the buffer containing codec-specific header data.
    //!  - @p headers_size - size of the header buffer in bytes.
    //!
    //! @remarks
    //!  This function sets up the decoder using the provided headers, which contain
    //!  essential configuration information for decoding the audio stream. The headers
    //!  must be in the format required by the specific codec. This function must be
    //!  called before decoding any frames.
    //!
    //! @returns
    //!  - true if the headers are successfully processed and the decoder is initialized.
    //!  - false if there is an error in processing the headers.
    //!
    //! @pre
    //!  Must be called before begin_frame(), read_samples(), drop_samples(), or
    //!  end_frame().

    //!
    //! @returns
    //!  the position of the next sample that will be retrieved by read_samples().
    //!
    //! @remarks
    //!  The decoded stream position is affected by begin_frame(), read_samples(), and
    //!  drop_samples() methods. begin_frame() changes it according to the provided frame
    //!  position, however it depends on the implementation how exactly. read_samples()
    //!  and drop_samples() increase it by the number of samples they returned.

    //!  number of available samples per channel, or zero if there are no more
    //!  samples in the current frame, or if begin_frame() was not called yet.
    //!
    //! @remarks
    //!  The number of samples available is affected by begin_frame(), read_samples(), and
    //!  drop_samples(), and end_frame() methods. begin_frame() resets it according to the
    //!  provided frame size, however it depends on the implementation how exactly.
    //!  end_frame() resets it to zero. read_samples() and drop_samples() decrease it by
    //!  the number of samples they returned.

    //!
    //! @remarks
    //!  After this call, read_samples() will retrieve samples from given @p frame_data,
    //!  until
    //!  @p frame_size bytes are read or end_frame() is called.
    //!
    //! @note
    //!  @p frame_position defines the position of the frame in the encoded stream.
    //!  Decoder updates the decoded stream position according to @p frame_position,
    //!  but not necessary to the same value. Encoded and decoded stream positions
    //!  may be slightly different, depending on the codec implementation.

    //!
    //! @b Parameters
    //!  - @p samples - buffer to write decoded samples to
    //!  - @p n_samples - number of samples to be decoded (per channel)
    //!
    //! @remarks
    //!  Decodes samples from the current frame and writes them to the provided buffer.
    //!
    //! @returns
    //!  number of samples decoded per channel. The returned value can be fewer than
    //!  @p n_samples if there are no more samples in the current frame.
    //!
    //! @pre
    //!  This method may be called only between begin_frame() and end_frame().

    //!
    //! @remarks
    //!  Shifts the given number of samples from the left, as if read_samples() was called
    //!  and the result was dropped.
    //!
    //! @returns
    //!  number of samples shifted per channel. The returned value can be fewer than
    //!  @p n_samples if there are no more samples in the current frame.
    //!
    //! @pre
    //!  This method may be called only between begin_frame() and end_frame().
